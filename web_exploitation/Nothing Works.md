## Nothing Works 🚫⚙️

### Challenge Description

The *Nothing Works* challenge displays a static webpage with a discouraging message implying that every action fails. The goal of the challenge is to find the hidden flag associated with the page 🚩.

---

### Hint 💡

The challenge name and description suggest that normal interaction may not be required. Since this is a web-based challenge, inspecting the **client-side JavaScript** could reveal hidden logic or hardcoded data 💻.

### Initial Observation 👀

When the webpage was opened, it appeared **completely static**.
Clicking the button or interacting with the page had no visible effect, and no flag was displayed on the screen.

---

### Approach and Analysis 🔍

I opened the browser’s **Developer Tools** and inspected the page source. From there, I navigated to the JavaScript file linked to the page.

Inside the script, I found the following code snippet:

```js
setTimeout(()=>{
  n.innerText="DSCCTF{th3_b055_w45_d01ng_n0th1ng_2026}",
  e.innerText="Protocol complete."
},30000)
```

The flag was **directly hardcoded inside the JavaScript file**, meaning no actual exploitation or interaction was required to retrieve it.

---

### Exploitation Steps ⚙️

1. Opened the challenge webpage.
2. Opened **Inspect → Sources**.
3. Located and opened the JavaScript file.
4. Read the script and directly extracted the flag from the code.

---

### Result 🎉

The flag was found **directly inside the client-side JavaScript**, without needing to interact with the page or wait for any condition to be met.

---

### Flag 🚩

```
DSCCTF{th3_b055_w45_d01ng_n0th1ng_2026}
```
