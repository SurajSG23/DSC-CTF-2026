Initial Observation 👀
When opening the website, the recipe page loads normally. The flag is not visible to regular users. Since the hint mentions cookies, it strongly suggests checking browser cookies for authentication or authorization logic 🕵️‍♂️.

Approach and Analysis 🔍
I opened the website and then opened the browser’s Developer Tools. From there, I navigated to the **Application** tab and checked the **Cookies** section. I noticed a cookie related to user privileges where the value of `admin` was set to `false`.

Exploitation Steps ⚙️
I edited the cookie value and changed `admin` from `false` to `true`. After saving the change, I reloaded the webpage 🔄.

Result 🎉
After reloading the page with the modified cookie, the hidden content became visible and the flag was displayed on the screen ✨.

Flag 🚩
