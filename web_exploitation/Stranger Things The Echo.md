## 🧇🌌 Stranger Things: The Echo

### 🧩 Challenge Description

The **Stranger Things: The Echo** challenge presents a mysterious version of **Hawkins**, where everything appears normal at first glance.
However, subtle hints suggest that **this reality is not the only truth**.

The goal is to **identify what has changed**, understand the deception, and uncover the hidden flag 🚩.

---

### 💡 Hint

The challenge hints emphasize that:

* *The Upside Down doesn’t change everything — only a few things*
* *Pay close attention to what isn’t the same*
* *DO NOT TRUST THE LIGHTS*

This suggests a **visual and perceptual challenge**, rather than cryptography or brute force.

### 👀 Initial Observation

Visiting the main page (`/`) displays a short message indicating that this is **not the right place**, and suggests finding what is *normal*.

Exploring further revealed two important routes:

```
/normal
/upside-down
```

---

### 🔍 Approach and Analysis

#### `/normal`

The `/normal` page displays the following text:

```
Welcome to Hawkins
The town is quiet.

Everything is normal.

The lights are steady.

DO NOT TRUST THE LIGHTS
```

At first glance, nothing appears hidden in the HTML source. The page relies heavily on CSS for styling, but no encoded flag or comments are present.

---

#### `/upside-down`

The `/upside-down` page displays almost the **same text**, but with subtle differences:

```
Welc0me t0 Hawk1ns
The t0wn 1s qu13t.

Ev3ryth1ng 1s n0rmal.

The l1ghts ar3 st3ady.

DO NOT TRUST THE LIGHTS
```

Key observations:

* Only specific letters are altered:

  * `o → 0`
  * `i → 1`
  * `e → 3`
* The meaning of the text remains unchanged
* Only **a few characters differ**, matching the hint exactly

This strongly suggested that the altered text was **a distraction**, not the final answer.

---

### ⚙️ Exploitation Steps

After attempting route enumeration, text diffing, and decoding the altered characters, it became clear that:

* The challenge was **not about decoding the leetspeak**
* The Upside Down page existed to encourage **overthinking**
* The most important hint was **literal and visible**

The repeated warning:

```
DO NOT TRUST THE LIGHTS
```

combined with the **DSCCTF leetspeak flag style**, revealed the intended solution.

By converting the warning text into the standard DSCCTF leetspeak format, the correct flag was formed.

---

### 🎉 Result

Submitting the leetspeak version of the warning text successfully solved the challenge.

---

### 🚩 Flag

```
DSCCTF{d0_n0t_tru5t_th3_l1ght5_2026}
```

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaway

* Not every challenge requires deep decoding
* Visual clues and plain text hints can be **the solution itself**
* Overthinking is sometimes the trap

> The truth was right there — hidden in plain sight.
