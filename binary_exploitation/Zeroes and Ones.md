## Zeros and Ones 🔢⚪⚫

### Challenge Description

The *Zeros and Ones* challenge provides a long sequence of binary digits (`0` and `1`) with the hint:
**“Decoding this should be easy.”**
The goal is to correctly interpret the binary data and extract the hidden flag 🚩.

---

### Hint 💡

The challenge title and description strongly suggest **binary decoding**. Since only `0`s and `1`s are used, the most logical approach is to convert the binary data into readable text using a standard encoding format 💻.

### Initial Observation 👀

* The data consists purely of binary digits.
* Spaces appear to be for **readability only**.
* No encryption logic or scripts are involved — this is a **pure decoding challenge**.

---

### Approach and Analysis 🔍

I removed all spaces and treated the sequence as a continuous binary stream.
Since ASCII text is commonly encoded using **7-bit or 8-bit binary**, I tested both.

When decoded using **7-bit ASCII**, the binary stream converted cleanly into readable text and revealed the flag format clearly.

This confirms the intended encoding was **7-bit ASCII**.

---

### Exploitation Steps ⚙️

1. Removed all spaces from the binary string.
2. Grouped the binary digits into **7-bit chunks**.
3. Converted each 7-bit binary value into its ASCII character.
4. Read the decoded output to obtain the flag.

---

### Result 🎉

The binary data successfully decoded into a readable string containing the flag.

### Flag 🚩

```
DSCCTF{z3r0s_4nd_0n3s_4r3_34sy}
```

### Key Takeaway 🧠

Not all challenges require exploitation or reversing code. Sometimes, **simple data decoding** is all that’s needed. Always identify the encoding format before trying complex techniques.
