## ⭐🍫 Five Star

### 🧩 Challenge Description

The **Five Star** challenge is a fun, meme-based task inspired by the famous **Five Star chocolate** tagline:

> *“Eat Five Star, do nothing.”*

The challenge provides an option to **download an image of a Five Star chocolate**, intentionally tempting players to overanalyze it.

The objective is to identify when **no action is required** and submit the correct flag 🚩.

---

### 💡 Hint

The title itself is the biggest hint.

> **Five Star**
> **Do nothing**

This strongly suggests that the challenge is **conceptual**, not technical.

---

### 🌐 Challenge Context

The challenge page includes:

* A button or link to **download an image of a Five Star chocolate**
* No input fields
* No interactive elements
* No scripts performing transformations

This setup encourages players to:

* Inspect metadata
* Look for steganography
* Attempt unnecessary analysis

—all of which are **intentional distractions**.

---

### 👀 Initial Observation

Downloading and viewing the image revealed:

* No hidden text
* No metadata clues
* No steganographic content

The image exists purely to **mislead** and reinforce the meme reference.

---

### 🔍 Approach and Analysis

Given:

* The lack of technical clues
* The absence of hidden data in the image
* The explicit cultural reference to the Five Star slogan

The intended solution becomes clear:

> **The correct action is to do nothing.**

There is no hidden payload in the image, and no decoding or exploitation is required.

---

### ⚙️ Exploitation Steps

There are no exploitation steps for this challenge.

The correct solution is to submit the **empty DSCCTF flag format**.
